	Hi there! 
	<br><br>
	I`m a uni student who likes computers, anime, games, photography and various other things. 
	I`ll often be reading LNs, manga, watching anime or trying to overclock the hell out of my PC in my spare time, 
	as well as doing some translation. 
	<br><br>
	You might also find me on other sites. My usernames usually tend to be "Haxed" or some variant of it.
